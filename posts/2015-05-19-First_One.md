sed to manipulate capture groups
-------------------

First post here.  Instead of manually editing the posts.json file in this repo, I want to have it autogenerate off of the posts in the posts directory. So defining posts as having the file name in the structure
```    YYYY-MM-DD-POST_NAME.md ```
I want a json like
```
    [
      {"file": "2015-04-21-First_One.md"},
      {"file": "2015-04-24-Second_One.md"}
    ]
```
Solution was to loop through the files and output the file name in the correct output to the json file using bash.
```
echo "[" > posts.json
for f in posts/*
do
    printf '{"file": "%s"},\n' $f >> posts.json
done
sed -i '' '$s/.$/]/' posts.json
```
Not too much, but wanted to put up a first post (on something tech related).
Now all you have to do is call the makefile to autogenerate that json. WOOO
